## 🎯 **What You'll See**

After setup, you'll see a GUI overlay in your **Scene view** (top-left corner) with:

- **🔥 Firebase** - Test loading solutions from Firebase
- **🏠 Local** - Test creating local solutions
- **🎮 Level** - Test level mode exit functionality
- **Configuration fields** for solution ID and level ID
- **Real-time status** and error reporting

## 🔧 **Quick Test**

1. **Set the Solution ID** to `gx6Aty5qinR7YsXhaynl` (from your recent logs)
2. **Click 🔥 Firebase** to test loading a real solution
3. **Watch the console** for detailed logs
4. **See the solution load** into your project

## 📊 **Features**

### **Firebase Testing**
- ✅ Real Firebase connection
- ✅ Live solution data
- ✅ Same setup as mobile app
- ✅ Tests actual solution loading

### **Local Testing**
- ✅ Project integration
- ✅ Serialization testing
- ✅ Solution creation
- ✅ No Firebase required

### **Level Mode Testing**
- ✅ Level state management
- ✅ Banner testing
- ✅ State verification
- ✅ Exit functionality

## 🐛 **Debugging**

### **Console Logs**
All operations are logged with these prefixes:
- `[EditorSolutionTester]` - General test operations
- `[SolutionSerializer]` - Solution loading operations
- `[Leaderboard]` - Firebase operations
- `[LevelBannerUI]` - Level state changes

### **GUI Status**
The tester GUI shows:
- Current test status
- Last test result
- Any errors that occurred
- Real-time feedback

## 🎮 **Usage Examples**

### **Test Firebase Solution Loading**
1. Set `testSolutionId` to a real solution ID
2. Click **🔥 Firebase** button
3. Watch the solution load into your project
4. Check console for detailed logs

### **Test Local Solution Creation**
1. Make sure you have components in your project
2. Click **🏠 Local** button
3. Tests complete serialization/deserialization
4. Verifies solution creation works

### **Test Level Mode Exit**
1. Start a level in your project
2. Click **🎮 Level** button
3. Verify level banner disappears
4. Confirm you can edit freely

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **Test Solution ID**
- Default: `gx6Aty5qinR7YsXhaynl` (from your recent logs)
- Change this to test different solutions
- Use context menu "Set Test Solution ID from Logs" to update

### **Test Level ID**
- Default: `NOT Gate`
- Used for local solution creation
- Should match your test level

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Firebase Connection Issues**
- Make sure Firebase is properly configured
- Check that `google-services.json` is in the project
- Verify Firebase initialization in console logs

### **Solution Loading Issues**
- Check that the solution ID exists in Firebase
- Verify the solution has valid JSON data
- Check console logs for detailed error messages

### **Level Mode Issues**
- Make sure you're in a level when testing level mode exit
- Check that LevelManager is properly initialized
- Verify the level banner disappears after exit

## 🎯 **Benefits**

- **No Mobile Deployment**: Test everything in the Unity Editor
- **Real Firebase Data**: Test with actual solutions from your database
- **Fast Iteration**: Test changes immediately without builds
- **Debug Issues**: Identify problems before mobile testing
- **Validate Fixes**: Confirm your level state fix works

## 📝 **Context Menu Options**

Right-click on the tester components for:
- **Setup Solution Tester**: Add the tester component
- **Remove Solution Tester**: Remove the tester component
- **Set Test Solution ID from Logs**: Update the test solution ID
- **Clear Test Results**: Clear the GUI status

## 🎉 **Success!**

Once setup, you can:
- Test solution loading without mobile deployment
- Debug issues in the Unity Editor
- Validate your fixes immediately
- Test with real Firebase data
- Save hours of build time!

The tester will appear as a GUI overlay in your Scene view and provide all the testing functionality you need for solution loading development.
