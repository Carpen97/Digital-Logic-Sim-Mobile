## Alternative: Binary Patcher Tool

### When to Consider
- Full rebuild not immediately feasible
- Need emergency patch for live builds

### Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot use with tamper-proofing or anti-cheat
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Primarily effective for Windows builds
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex for Android/iOS
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not recommended as primary solution

### Process (If Needed)
1. Download Binary Patcher from Unity advisory
2. Apply to existing builds
3. Test patched builds
4. Distribute patched versions

**Recommendation**: Use full rebuild (Option 1) - cleaner and more reliable
