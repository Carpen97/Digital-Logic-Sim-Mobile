- **Fixes:** 
- **Retested:** 

### Level 2: SR Latch (lvl.srlatch.1)
- **Status:** Not tested
- **Issues:** 
- **Fixes:** 
- **Retested:** 

### Level 3: D Latch (lvl.dlatch.1) ⭐ NEW
- **Status:** ✅ Added & Fixed
- **Issues:** 
  - MISSING from original level set - important for teaching progression
  - Gap between SR Latch and D Flip-Flop needed level-triggered D Latch
  - Initial test vectors had incorrect expected values
- **Fixes:** 
  - Added new D Latch level with level-triggered behavior
  - 2 inputs: D (data) and Enable
  - 2 outputs: Q and Q'
  - Transparent mode: When Enable=1, Q follows D immediately
  - Latch mode: When Enable=0, Q holds its value
  - Added setup phase: ["00", "10", "00"] to initialize circuit state
  - 10 test vectors covering transparent and latched modes
  - Fixed expected values to match D Latch behavior
  - 5 helpful hints explaining level-triggered vs edge-triggered behavior
- **Retested:** Pending user validation

### Level 4: D Flip-Flop (lvl.dflipflop.1)
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed
- **Issues:** 
  - outputCount was 1 but outputLabels had 2 entries (Q and Qn) - configuration mismatch
  - Missing Q' (complement) output in actual output count
  - Description didn't explain rising edge triggering clearly
  - Test vectors only checked Q output, not Q' complement
  - Initial state assumptions in test vectors didn't match circuit behavior
- **Fixes:** 
  - Changed outputCount from 1 to 2
  - Changed "Qn" to "Q'" for standard notation
  - Enhanced description to explain rising edge behavior and complement output
  - Updated all test vectors to validate both Q and Q' outputs
  - Adjusted test vectors to match actual initial state (Q=1, Q'=0)
  - Added more comprehensive test sequence with 11 vectors
  - Improved hints to include characteristic equation and complement behavior
- **Retested:** Pending user validation

---

## Chapter 4: Advanced Arithmetic (4 levels)

### Level 1: 4-bit Subtractor (lvl.subtractor.1)
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed (Pre-testing)
- **Issues:** 
  - CRITICAL: All test vectors had completely wrong expected values
  - Test vectors showed A=B cases expecting "00000" (correct) but other cases were invalid
  - Example: A=1, B=0 (1-0=1) expected "11111" instead of "00010"
  - Many test vectors were redundant (all testing A=B scenarios)
- **Fixes:** 
  - Corrected all expected outputs to match actual A - B subtraction
  - Added 6 new diverse test cases covering:
    - A < B cases (negative results with borrow)
    - A > B cases (positive results, no borrow)
    - Various bit patterns and edge cases
  - Total test vectors: 26 (20 A=B cases + 6 diverse cases)
  - All values verified using two's complement arithmetic: A + (~B + 1)
- **Retested:** Pending user validation 

### Level 2: 4-bit Comparator (lvl.comparator.1)
- **Status:** Not tested
- **Issues:** 
- **Fixes:** 
- **Retested:** 

### Level 3: Simple ALU (lvl.alu_simple.1)
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed (2nd iteration)
- **Issues:** 
  - All test vectors had incorrect expected values
  - Test vectors didn't match the actual encoding scheme (A first, B second, Op last)
  - User found circuit error, required second correction of 13 test vectors
- **Fixes:** 
  - Regenerated all 27 test vectors to match actual circuit encoding
  - Updated expected values based on actual circuit output (1st pass)
  - Corrected 13 additional test vectors after user fixed circuit bug (2nd pass)
  - Encoding: A0-A3 (bits 1-4, MSB first), B0-B3 (bits 5-8, MSB first), Op (bit 9)
  - Output: Carry/Borrow (bit 1), Result0-Result3 (bits 2-5, MSB first)
- **Retested:** User validated with corrected circuit, all tests now pass 

### Level 4: Complete 4-bit ALU (lvl.alu_complete.1)
- **Status:** ✅ Enhanced with Comprehensive Test Vectors
- **Issues:** 
  - Had only 21 sample test vectors (out of 1024 possible combinations)
  - Insufficient coverage for a complex 10-input circuit
- **Fixes:** 
  - Generated and integrated ALL 1024 test vectors covering every possible input combination
  - Test vectors auto-generated from user's working circuit using new 'G' keyboard shortcut
  - Comprehensive validation ensures ALU correctly implements all 4 operations:
    - Op=00: A AND B
    - Op=01: A OR B
    - Op=10: A + B (with carry)
    - Op=11: A - B (with borrow/carry)
  - Test vectors saved to Assets/GeneratedTestVectors/lvl.alu_complete.1_testvectors.json
  - Successfully integrated into levels.json with proper JSON formatting
- **Retested:** Pending user validation

## Issue Categories

### Critical (Game-Breaking)
- **BitVector.FromString**: Bit order reversal bug causing ALL levels to fail validation - FIXED ✅
  - `FromString` was reading left-to-right but assigning to bit 0 (LSB)
  - `ToString` was outputting highest bit first
  - This caused complete reversal of expected vs actual outputs
  - Fixed by reversing bit assignment: `1UL << (len - 1 - i)` instead of `1UL << i`
- **D Flip-Flop (lvl.dflipflop.1)**: Output count mismatch prevented level validation - FIXED ✅

### High Priority (Validation/Logic Issues)
- **D Flip-Flop (lvl.dflipflop.1)**: Test vectors didn't match actual circuit behavior - FIXED ✅
- **Missing D Latch level**: Gap in sequential circuits teaching progression - ADDED ✅
- **4-bit Subtractor (lvl.subtractor.1)**: All test vector expected values were incorrect - FIXED ✅
  - Example: 1-0=1 expected "11111" (-1) instead of "00010" (1)
  - Most test vectors only tested A=B=0 edge case

### Medium Priority (Description/Clarity Issues)
- None found yet

### Low Priority (Polish/Minor Issues)
- None found yet

## Notes
- Testing started from Chapter 1, Level 1
- All fixes will be applied to Assets/Resources/levels.json
- Each fix will be retested before moving to next level

### Major Discovery
**CRITICAL BUG FOUND**: BitVector bit order reversal (Assets/Scripts/Levels/BitVector.cs)
- This bug affected ALL level validations across the entire game!
- Inputs/outputs were being reversed during parsing
- Example: Input "01" was being read as "10"
- This explains why levels appeared to be "matching" visually but still failing
- **Impact**: Every single level in the game was potentially affected
- **Status**: FIXED - Changed bit assignment in FromString() method
- **Action Required**: All 26 levels should be retested to ensure proper validation

### New Features Added

**1. Setup Phase for Test Sequences**
- Added `setup` field to TestSequence in LevelDefinition.cs
- Allows pre-initialization of sequential circuits before test vectors run
- Setup inputs are applied but not validated (for establishing known state)
- Validator updated to process setup[] before running vectors[]
- Used in D Latch level to ensure consistent initial state

**2. Auto-Generate Test Vectors (Editor Only)**
- Added `GenerateTestVectors()` method to LevelManager.cs
- Keyboard shortcut 'G' triggers test vector generation from current circuit
- Iterates through all possible input combinations (2^inputCount)
- Simulates circuit and captures outputs for each input pattern
- Exports to JSON: `Assets/GeneratedTestVectors/{levelId}_testvectors.json`
- Also copies JSON to clipboard for easy pasting
- Wrapped in `#if UNITY_EDITOR` - not included in production builds
- Used successfully to generate 1024 test vectors for Complete 4-bit ALU
- Integration: PowerShell script extracts and replaces test vectors in levels.json

**3. Random Test Vector Sampling for Combinational Levels**
- Modified LevelValidator.cs to cap combinational test vectors at 40 per validation run
- If a level has more than 40 test vectors, randomly selects 40 unique tests
- Different random selection each validation (not deterministic)
- Improves performance for levels with many test vectors (like Complete 4-bit ALU with 1024)
- Prevents scrollbar UI issues with too many test results
- Sequential levels with test sequences are unaffected (still run all tests)
- Logs message when random selection occurs: "Testing 40 randomly selected vectors out of X available"

**4. UI Improvement: Levels Menu Selection**
- Fixed bug in LevelsMenu.cs where clicking selected level would unselect it
- Now clicking already selected level keeps it selected (better UX consistency)
