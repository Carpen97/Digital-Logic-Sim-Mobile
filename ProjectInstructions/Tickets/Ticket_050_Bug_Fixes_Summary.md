## **Bugs Fixed**

### **Bug #1: JUMP UP doesn't auto-expand target nested collection** ‚úÖ
**Issue**: When using JUMP UP to move a chip from one nested collection to another nested collection, the target collection would not auto-expand, hiding the moved chip.

**Example**:
- BUTTON chip in "8-bit" nested collection
- Press JUMP UP ‚Üí moves to "4-bit" nested collection
- ‚ùå "4-bit" stayed collapsed, BUTTON was hidden
- ‚úÖ NOW: "4-bit" auto-expands, BUTTON is visible

**Files Changed**:
- `Assets/Scripts/Graphics/UI/Menus/ChipLibraryMenu.cs`

**Code Changes**:
```csharp
// Line 849 - Added after JUMP UP for nested chips
targetNestedCollection.IsToggledOpen = true;

// Line 881 - Added after JUMP DOWN for nested chips
targetNestedCollection.IsToggledOpen = true;
```

---

### **Bug #2: UNNEST enabled for chips in top-level collections** ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Chips in top-level collections (like PULSE in BASIC) had UNNEST button enabled, which would move them to the collection below. This violates the architectural rule that chips must always be inside a collection.

**Example**:
- PULSE chip in "BASIC" collection (top-level)
- ‚ùå UNNEST was enabled, pressing it moved PULSE to "IN/OUT" collection
- ‚úÖ NOW: UNNEST is disabled (grayed out) for chips in top-level collections

**Files Changed**:
- `Assets/Scripts/Graphics/UI/Menus/ChipLibraryMenu.cs`

**Code Changes**:
```csharp
// Line 604 - Changed from:
bool canJumpOut = true; // Chips can always jump out of collections

// To:
bool canJumpOut = false; // Chips in top-level collections cannot jump out (must stay in a collection)
```

**Updated UNNEST Rules**:
| Element Type | UNNEST Enabled? |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Chip in top-level collection | ‚ùå **DISABLED** (FIXED) |
| Chip in nested collection | ‚úÖ Enabled |
| Nested collection | ‚úÖ Enabled |
| Top-level collection | ‚ùå DISABLED |

### **Bug #3: Elements out of view after JUMP operations** ‚úÖ
**Issue**: After using JUMP UP or JUMP DOWN to move an element to a different collection (possibly far away in the list), the moved element would remain selected but be off-screen, requiring manual scrolling to find it.

**Example**:
- BUTTON chip in "8-bit" nested collection (near bottom of scroll view)
- Press JUMP UP ‚Üí moves to "4-bit" nested collection (near top)
- ‚úÖ NOW: Collections panel auto-scrolls to show BUTTON in "4-bit"
- Element is centered in the viewport for easy visibility

**Files Changed**:
- `Assets/Scripts/Graphics/UI/Menus/ChipLibraryMenu.cs`

**Code Changes**:
```csharp
// Line 73 - Added flag to track when scrolling is needed
static bool shouldScrollToSelection;

// Line 307 - Added auto-scroll logic after drawing scroll view
if (shouldScrollToSelection)
{
    ScrollToSelectedElement();
    shouldScrollToSelection = false;
}

// Lines 2333-2414 - Added ScrollToSelectedElement() method
// Calculates the approximate Y position of the selected element
// Scrolls the Collections panel to center the element in viewport

// Lines 718, 724, 860, 893, 987, 999, 1113, 1124 - Set flag after JUMP operations
shouldScrollToSelection = true;
```

**How It Works**:
1. After any JUMP operation, `shouldScrollToSelection` flag is set to `true`
2. On the next frame, after drawing the scroll view, `ScrollToSelectedElement()` is called
3. The method calculates the Y position of the selected element by:
   - Counting collections before the selected one
   - Accounting for expanded/collapsed states
   - Adding heights of nested collections and chips
4. Sets `scrollState.scrollY` to scroll to the calculated position
5. Centers the element in the viewport for best visibility

## **Testing Checklist**

### **Test Bug Fix #1: Auto-Expand on JUMP UP/DOWN**
- [ ] Create nested collections with chips inside
- [ ] Collapse a nested collection
- [ ] Select a chip in another nested collection
- [ ] Press JUMP UP or JUMP DOWN to move to the collapsed nested collection
- [ ] **Verify**: Target nested collection auto-expands
- [ ] **Verify**: Moved chip is visible and selected

### **Test Bug Fix #2: UNNEST Disabled for Top-Level Chips**
- [ ] Open Chip Library
- [ ] Expand any top-level collection (e.g., BASIC, IN/OUT)
- [ ] Select a chip directly in that collection (not in a nested collection)
- [ ] **Verify**: UNNEST button is grayed out (disabled)
- [ ] Try clicking UNNEST
- [ ] **Verify**: Nothing happens (button doesn't respond)

### **Test Bug Fix #3: Auto-Scroll After JUMP Operations**
- [ ] Open Chip Library with many collections (scroll down to see them all)
- [ ] Scroll to the bottom and select a chip in a collection near the bottom
- [ ] Press JUMP UP to move to a collection near the top
- [ ] **Verify**: Collections panel auto-scrolls to show the moved chip
- [ ] **Verify**: Moved chip is visible (approximately centered in viewport)
- [ ] **Verify**: Chip remains selected (blue highlight)
- [ ] Try the reverse: select chip near top, JUMP DOWN to bottom
- [ ] **Verify**: Auto-scroll works in both directions
- [ ] Test with nested collections: move chip between nested collections in different parent collections
- [ ] **Verify**: Auto-scroll works for nested collections too

### **Regression Tests**
- [ ] Test all other movement buttons still work correctly
- [ ] Test MOVE UP/DOWN within collections
- [ ] Test NEST functionality
- [ ] Test UNNEST for chips in nested collections (should still work)
- [ ] Test UNNEST for nested collections (should still work)
- [ ] Verify selection persists after moves
- [ ] Verify no crashes or errors
