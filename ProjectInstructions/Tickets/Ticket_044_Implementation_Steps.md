Set correct path to Android SDK
```

**"IL2CPP build failed"**
```
Fix: Check console for specific error
Common causes:
- Missing Android NDK
- Insufficient disk space
- Corrupted cache (delete Library/Il2cppBuildCache)
```

**"Keystore not found"**
```
Fix: Publishing Settings â†’ Keystore
Set path to: Desktop/DLS.keystore
Enter keystore password
```

### Firebase Errors

**"Firebase not initializing"**
```
Check:
1. google-services.json is in Assets/
2. Firebase SDK is properly imported
3. Internet connection available
4. Firebase Console shows app is active
```

### Performance Issues

**"Build is slower than before"**
```
- Expected after Unity upgrade
- Run on actual device, not simulator
- Check IL2CPP optimization settings
- Compare build size to previous version
```
