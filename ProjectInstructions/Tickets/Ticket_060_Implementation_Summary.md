# Ticket 060 - Two-Finger Panning During Wire Placement (Mobile)
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Priority:** High (UX/Usability Issue)  
**Type:** Mobile Input Behavior Fix

## üìã Problem Statement

**Critical Issue:** Single-finger dragging moved the camera during wire placement mode, causing users to accidentally pan the camera when trying to place wires. This made wire routing imprecise and frustrating on mobile devices.

**User Pain Point:** "I'm trying to place a wire, but every time I drag my finger, the whole view moves! I can't route wires properly!"

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Two-Finger Panning Requirement (Mobile)
**File:** `Assets/Scripts/Game/Interaction/CameraController.cs`

**Changes:**
- Added detection for wire placement mode: `bool isPlacingWire = Project.ActiveProject.controller.IsCreatingWire;`
- Implemented dynamic touch count requirement:
  - **During wire placement:** Requires 2 fingers for camera panning
  - **Normal mode:** Uses single finger for camera panning (existing behavior)
- Logic: `int requiredTouchCount = isPlacingWire ? 2 : 1;`

**Key Code Section (lines 199-202):**
```csharp
bool isPlacingWire = Project.ActiveProject.controller.IsCreatingWire;
// During wire placement, require two fingers for panning. Otherwise, use single finger.
int requiredTouchCount = isPlacingWire ? 2 : 1;
bool canPanWithCurrentTouchCount = UnityEngine.Input.touchCount >= requiredTouchCount;
```

### 2. Wire Placement Banner UI
**File:** `Assets/Scripts/Graphics/UI/Menus/WirePlacementBanner.cs` (NEW)

**Features:**
- **Visual Indicator:** Banner displays "Placing Wire" at the top of the screen
- **Mode Display:** Shows current straight wires mode (Off / If Grid Shown / On)
- **Interactive Toggle:** Tap banner to cycle through straight wires modes
- **Design Consistency:** Matches existing banner design (eraser tool, level banners)
- **Priority:** Highest priority - displays above eraser, sim paused, and level banners

**Banner Layout:**
```

```

**Mode Cycling:**
1. Off (0) ‚Üí If Grid Shown (1) ‚Üí On (2) ‚Üí Off (0)
2. Directly modifies `project.description.Prefs_StraightWires`
3. Changes take effect immediately during wire placement

### 3. UI Integration
**File:** `Assets/Scripts/Graphics/UI/UIDrawer.cs`

**Changes:**
- Added wire placement banner to the banner priority system
- **Priority Order:** WirePlacement > Eraser > SimPaused > Level
- Checks `project.controller?.IsCreatingWire` to show/hide banner

**Key Code Section (lines 123-129):**
```csharp
bool showWirePlacementBanner = project.controller?.IsCreatingWire ?? false;

// Priority order: WirePlacement > Eraser > SimPaused > Level
if (showWirePlacementBanner) WirePlacementBanner.DrawBanner();
else if (showEraserBanner) EraserModeBanner.DrawBanner();
else if (showSimPausedBanner) SimPausedUI.DrawPausedBanner();
else if (showLevelBanner) LevelBannerUI.DrawLevelBanner();
```

## üìù Testing Checklist

### Core Functionality Tests:
- [ ] **Wire Placement with Single Finger:**
  - [ ] Start placing a wire from a pin
  - [ ] Single-finger drag should NOT pan camera
  - [ ] Wire anchor point should move with finger
  - [ ] Can add wire points successfully

- [ ] **Camera Panning with Two Fingers:**
  - [ ] While placing a wire, use two-finger drag
  - [ ] Camera should pan smoothly
  - [ ] Wire placement should remain active
  - [ ] Can switch back to single-finger wire manipulation

- [ ] **Normal Mode (Not Placing Wires):**

## üé® Design Decisions

### Why Two Fingers for Panning?
- **Consistency:** Matches common mobile UX patterns (two-finger scroll in modals)
- **Precision:** Eliminates accidental camera movement during wire routing
- **Discovery:** Users naturally try two fingers when one doesn't work

### Why Banner Toggle for Straight Wires?
- **Convenience:** Quick access without opening preferences menu
- **Context:** Most relevant during wire placement
- **Discoverability:** Clear "(Tap to toggle)" instruction

### Banner Priority Rationale:
1. **WirePlacement** - Active task context
2. **Eraser** - Active tool state
3. **SimPaused** - Simulation state
4. **Level** - General context
