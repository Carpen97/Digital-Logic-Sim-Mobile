# TICKET 050: Firebase/Leaderboard Support in Unity Editor

**Created:** October 11, 2025  
**Completed:** October 11, 2025  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Type:** Investigation / Development  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Firebase works in Unity Editor!

---

## Problem Statement

Currently, Firebase features (authentication, Firestore, leaderboards) are not accessible when running the game in Unity Editor. Developers must build the game to PC to test these features, which significantly slows down the development/testing cycle.

### Current Workflow (Slow)
1. Make changes to code
2. Build entire game to PC
3. Launch PC build
4. Test Firebase features
5. Repeat for each change

### Desired Workflow (Fast)
1. Make changes to code
2. Press Play in Unity Editor
3. Test Firebase features directly
4. Iterate quickly

---

## Objectives

### Primary Goal
Enable Firebase connectivity (authentication, Firestore, Storage, leaderboards) to work when running the game in Unity Editor on Windows.

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Firebase Authentication works in Unity Editor
- ✅ Firestore database reads/writes work in Unity Editor
- ✅ Firebase Storage uploads/downloads work in Unity Editor
- ✅ Leaderboard submission and retrieval works in Unity Editor
- ✅ No degradation of functionality in actual builds
- ✅ Clear error messages if connection fails

---

## ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Root Cause Identified
The Firebase Unity SDK v13.2.0 **fully supports Windows Editor mode**, but three issues were blocking it:

1. **Code Blocks:** `#if UNITY_EDITOR` guards in `FirebaseBootstrap.cs` and `FirebaseProbe.cs` were preventing initialization
2. **Plugin Configuration:** Firebase native DLLs had `Editor: enabled: 0` in their `.meta` files - causing `DllNotFoundException`
3. **Leaderboard Service:** Always used mock storage in Editor instead of real Firebase

### Changes Made

#### 1. Code Changes ✅
- **FirebaseBootstrap.cs:** Removed `#if UNITY_EDITOR` block that skipped initialization
- **FirebaseProbe.cs:** Updated to defer to FirebaseBootstrap for all platforms
- **LeaderboardService.cs:** Added `UseLocalStorageInEditor` flag (default: false = use real Firebase)

#### 2. Plugin Configuration ✅
Updated `.meta` files for all Firebase DLLs in `Assets/Firebase/Plugins/x86_64/`:
- `FirebaseCppApp-13_2_0.dll.meta`
- `FirebaseCppAuth.dll.meta`
- `FirebaseCppFirestore.dll.meta`
- `FirebaseCppStorage.dll.meta`

Changed from:
```yaml
Editor:
  enabled: 0  # ❌ Blocked DLLs in Editor
```

To:
```yaml
Editor:
  enabled: 1  # ✅ Now works!
  CPU: x86_64
  OS: Windows
```

#### 3. Configuration Files ✅
- `google-services-desktop.json` already properly configured in `StreamingAssets/`

## Investigation Tasks

### Phase 1: Understand Current Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Document current Firebase SDK version - **v13.2.0**
- [x] Review existing Firebase initialization code - **Found in FirebaseBootstrap.cs**
- [x] Identify where Firebase is initialized (which script, when) - **FirebaseBootstrap.cs, called from game startup**
- [x] Check if there are platform-specific #if directives blocking Editor - **YES! Found #if UNITY_EDITOR blocks**
- [x] Review Firebase configuration files (google-services.json, etc.) - **Properly configured**
- [x] Document current error messages when attempting to use Firebase in Editor - **DllNotFoundException due to disabled DLLs**

**Files to Review:**
- Firebase initialization scripts
- Platform-specific Firebase wrappers
- `google-services.json` / `google-services-desktop.json`
- Any authentication/leaderboard manager scripts

### Phase 2: Research Solutions ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Check Firebase Unity SDK documentation for Editor support - **Confirmed: v13.2.0 supports Desktop/Editor**
- [x] Research if Firebase SDK supports Windows Standalone (Desktop) mode - **YES, fully supported**
- [x] Investigate if `google-services-desktop.json` needs configuration - **Already properly configured**
- [x] Check if Firebase SDK requires specific Unity Player Settings for Editor - **No special settings needed**
- [x] Research community solutions / known workarounds - **Found GitHub issues about Windows crashes**
- [x] Review Firebase Console settings for allowed platforms - **No changes needed**

**Key Questions:**
1. Does Firebase Unity SDK officially support Editor mode?
2. What authentication methods work in Editor (Anonymous, Email, Google, etc.)?
3. Are there any security/configuration changes needed in Firebase Console?
4. Do we need separate Firebase project for development vs production?

### Phase 3: Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
Based on Phase 1 & 2 findings:
- [x] What code changes are needed - **Remove #if UNITY_EDITOR blocks, add UseLocalStorageInEditor flag**
- [x] What configuration changes are needed - **Enable Firebase DLLs in Editor via .meta files**
- [x] What Firebase Console settings need adjustment - **None needed**
- [x] Estimated development time - **Actual: 2 hours** (Investigation + Implementation)
- [x] Potential risks/limitations - **Documented in Firebase_Editor_Setup_Guide.md**

## Technical Context

### Known Firebase Files in Project
```
Assets/
  ├── StreamingAssets/
  │   └── google-services-desktop.json
  ├── google-services.json
  └── Firebase/
      └── Editor/
          ├── FirebaseAuth_version-13.2.0_manifest.txt
          ├── FirebaseFirestore_version-13.2.0_manifest.txt
          └── FirebaseStorage_version-13.2.0_manifest.txt
```

### Suspected Issues
1. **Platform Detection:** Code might be checking for mobile platform and skipping initialization
2. **Configuration:** Desktop configuration might not be properly set up
3. **SDK Version:** Might need newer Firebase SDK version
4. **Build Settings:** Unity Player Settings might need adjustment
5. **Preprocessor Directives:** Code might be wrapped in `#if !UNITY_EDITOR`

---

## Potential Solutions (To Investigate)

### Solution 1: Enable Desktop Firebase
- Use `google-services-desktop.json` for Windows Editor
- Ensure Firebase SDK supports standalone/desktop mode
- Might require minimal code changes

### Solution 2: Conditional Initialization
```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR
    // Initialize Firebase for Editor (Windows Standalone mode)
    FirebaseApp.CheckAndFixDependenciesAsync().ContinueWith(task => {
        var dependencyStatus = task.Result;
        if (dependencyStatus == DependencyStatus.Available) {
            // Initialize Firebase
        }
    });
#else
    // Mobile initialization
#endif
```

### Solution 3: Mock/Stub Services (Fallback)
If native Firebase doesn't work in Editor:
- Create mock Firebase services for Editor testing
- Use actual Firebase only in builds
- Less ideal but better than current workflow

---

## Success Metrics

### Development Speed
- **Before:** 5-10 minutes per test iteration (build + launch)
- **Target:** 10-30 seconds per test iteration (press Play)
- **Expected Improvement:** 10-30x faster iteration

### Feature Coverage
- Authentication: Sign in, Sign out, User state persistence
- Firestore: Read/write game data, queries
- Storage: Upload/download user content
- Leaderboards: Submit scores, retrieve rankings

---

## Risks & Considerations

### Technical Risks
- Firebase SDK might not fully support Editor mode
- Desktop authentication might have limitations (e.g., no Google Sign-In UI)
- Performance differences between Editor and Build
- Security implications of development credentials

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Use separate Firebase project for development
2. Document any Editor-specific limitations
3. Add clear logging/warnings in Editor mode
4. Maintain build testing as final validation step
5. Consider using Firebase Emulator Suite for local testing
