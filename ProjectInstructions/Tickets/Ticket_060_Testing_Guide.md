# Ticket 060 - Testing Guide: Two-Finger Panning During Wire Placement

## üéØ Quick Test (2 minutes)

### Test 1: Wire Placement - Single Finger Does NOT Pan
1. Open project on mobile device (Android or iOS)
2. Create a chip with at least two pins
3. Tap on a pin to start placing a wire
4. **Expected:** Yellow banner appears at top: "Placing Wire"
5. Use single finger to drag around the screen
6. **Expected:** Camera does NOT move, wire anchor point follows finger
7. Tap to place the wire anchor point
8. **Expected:** Wire point is placed, still in wire placement mode

### Test 2: Wire Placement - Two Fingers DO Pan
1. While still placing a wire (from Test 1)
2. Use two fingers to drag around the screen
3. **Expected:** Camera DOES pan/move
4. Release and use single finger again
5. **Expected:** Wire placement continues normally
6. **Success!** Wire placement and camera control are now separated

### Test 3: Banner Toggle (Bonus Feature!)
1. While placing a wire
2. Tap the yellow "Placing Wire" banner at the top
3. **Expected:** Text changes between:
   - "Straight Wires: Off"
   - "Straight Wires: If Grid Shown"
   - "Straight Wires: On"
4. Place a wire with "Straight Wires: On"
5. **Expected:** Wire follows straight grid-aligned paths
6. **Success!** Quick toggle works without opening preferences

### Test 4: Normal Mode Still Works
1. Cancel wire placement (tap cancel button or press back)
2. **Expected:** Banner disappears
3. Use single finger to drag around
4. **Expected:** Camera pans normally (old behavior restored)
5. Use two fingers to pinch
6. **Expected:** Zoom works normally
7. **Success!** Normal mode unchanged

## üìã Detailed Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Wire Placement
**Setup:**
- Open any chip with at least 2 pins
- Tap on the first pin to start wire placement

**Test Steps:**
1. Observe yellow banner appears: "Placing Wire"
2. Single-finger drag in different directions
3. Verify camera does NOT move
4. Verify wire anchor point follows finger
5. Tap to add wire points
6. Use two-finger drag
7. Verify camera DOES pan
8. Complete wire or cancel
9. Verify banner disappears

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Banner appears on wire placement start
- ‚úÖ Single finger: wire control only
- ‚úÖ Two fingers: camera control
- ‚úÖ Banner disappears on completion/cancel

---

### Scenario 2: Banner Toggle Functionality
**Setup:**
- Start placing a wire to show banner

**Test Steps:**
1. Read banner text (shows current straight wires mode)
2. Tap the banner
3. Observe mode changes: Off ‚Üí If Grid Shown ‚Üí On ‚Üí Off
4. Set to "On" mode
5. Place wire and observe it snaps to grid
6. Set to "Off" mode
7. Place wire and observe free-form placement

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Tap cycles through 3 modes
- ‚úÖ Mode changes take effect immediately
- ‚úÖ Wire behavior matches selected mode

---

### Scenario 3: Edge Case - Finger Add/Remove
**Setup:**
- Start placing a wire

**Test Steps:**
1. Place one finger on screen (wire control)
2. Add second finger while first is down
3. Verify camera starts panning
4. Remove second finger (keep first down)
5. Verify camera stops panning
6. Verify wire control resumes

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Smooth transition when adding finger
- ‚úÖ Smooth transition when removing finger
- ‚úÖ No crashes or glitches

---

### Scenario 4: Banner Priority
**Setup:**
- Be in a level (to trigger level banner)
- Start placing a wire

**Test Steps:**
1. Verify wire placement banner shows (NOT level banner)
2. Cancel wire placement
3. Verify level banner now shows
4. Enable eraser mode
5. Verify eraser banner shows (NOT level banner)
6. Disable eraser mode
7. Verify level banner shows again

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Wire placement banner has highest priority
- ‚úÖ Banner switches correctly based on state
- ‚úÖ No overlapping banners

---

### Scenario 5: Pinch-to-Zoom Still Works
**Setup:**
- Start placing a wire

**Test Steps:**
1. Use two fingers in pinch gesture (fingers moving apart/together)
2. Verify zoom in/out works
3. Complete wire placement
4. Use two fingers in pinch gesture again
5. Verify zoom still works in normal mode

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Pinch-to-zoom works during wire placement
- ‚úÖ Pinch-to-zoom works in normal mode
- ‚úÖ No regression in zoom functionality

## üêõ Issues to Watch For

### Potential Issues:
1. **Banner doesn't appear:** Check `Project.ActiveProject.controller.IsCreatingWire` is true
2. **Single finger still pans camera:** Check platform defines are correct (`UNITY_ANDROID || UNITY_IOS`)
3. **Banner doesn't toggle:** Check touch detection in banner hitbox
4. **Camera panning feels laggy with two fingers:** Expected behavior - may need touch input smoothing (future enhancement)

### Debugging:
- Check Unity console for debug logs: `[WirePlacementBanner]` and `[CameraController]`
- Verify build target is Android or iOS (not standalone)
- Ensure touch input is enabled in Unity Player Settings
