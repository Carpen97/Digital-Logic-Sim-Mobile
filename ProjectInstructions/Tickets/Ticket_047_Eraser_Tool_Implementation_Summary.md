# Ticket 047: Toggleable Eraser Tool - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Overview
Implemented a toggleable eraser tool that streamlines the deletion workflow, allowing users to quickly delete components and wires with a single tap instead of the previous 2-tap workflow (select → delete).

---

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Always-Visible Trash Icon**
- ✅ Trash icon now always visible when in edit mode (previously only showed when component selected)
- ✅ Visual feedback: Icon highlights yellow when eraser mode is active
- ✅ Position: Kept in current location with other tools

### 2. **Eraser Mode Toggle**
- ✅ Tap trash icon to toggle eraser mode on/off
- ✅ Three modes: Off, Delete All, Wires Only
- ✅ Clear visual distinction between normal mode and eraser mode

### 3. **Immediate Deletion**
- ✅ Components delete immediately on tap in eraser mode (1 tap!)
- ✅ Wires delete immediately on tap in eraser mode (1 tap!)
- ✅ No selection step required
- ✅ Works for all component types (chips, pins, wires, etc.)

### 4. **Banner with Mode Information**
- ✅ Displays at **top** of screen when eraser mode is active (like level banner)
- ✅ Shows current mode: "Eraser Mode: Delete All" or "Eraser Mode: Wires Only"
- ✅ Banner is tappable to toggle between "Delete All" and "Wires Only" modes
- ✅ Semi-transparent black background (same style as level banner)
- ✅ Yellow text (same style as level banner)
- ✅ Clear visual design that's consistent with existing banners

### 5. **"Wires Only" Mode**
- ✅ Toggle between two eraser modes:
  - **Delete All**: Tap anything to delete (components + wires)
  - **Wires Only**: Tap wires to delete, components are safe
- ✅ Tap banner to switch modes
- ✅ Visual indication of current mode

## 📁 Files Created

### 1. `Assets/Scripts/Game/Interaction/EraserModeController.cs`
**Purpose**: Manages eraser mode state
- `EraserMode` enum: Off, DeleteAll, WiresOnly
- `ToggleEraserMode()`: Cycles through modes
- `ToggleWiresOnlyMode()`: Toggles between DeleteAll/WiresOnly
- `DisableEraserMode()`: Turns off eraser mode
- `GetModeText()`: Returns display text for current mode

### 2. `Assets/Scripts/Graphics/UI/Menus/EraserModeBanner.cs`
**Purpose**: Draws the eraser mode banner UI
- `DrawBanner()`: Renders banner at **top** of screen
- Displays current mode text
- Makes banner tappable to toggle modes (using touch input for mobile)
- Uses yellow text (same style as level banner)
- Manual click/tap detection for proper mobile support

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. `Assets/Scripts/Graphics/UI/MobileUIController.cs`
**Changes**:
- Added `isEraserModeActive` field
- Added `trashCanImage` reference for visual feedback
- **Line 125**: Trash icon now always visible (removed conditional)
- **Line 477-494**: `OnTrashCanPress()` now toggles eraser mode instead of deleting immediately
- **Line 594-607**: New `UpdateEraserModeVisualState()` method - highlights icon yellow when active
- **Line 188**: Calls visual state update every frame

### 2. `Assets/Scripts/Game/Interaction/ChipInteractionController.cs`
**Changes**:
- **Line 678-683**: Added eraser mode check in `HandleSingleTap()` for touch input
- **Line 835-840**: Added eraser mode check in `HandleLeftMouseDown()` for mouse input
- **Line 298-335**: New `HandleEraserModeTap()` method - performs immediate deletion
  - Handles DeleteAll mode: deletes any element
  - Handles WiresOnly mode: only deletes wires
- **Line 1554-1555**: Disables eraser mode when canceling operations

### 3. `Assets/Scripts/Graphics/UI/UIDrawer.cs`
**Changes**:
- **Line 116-117**: Added eraser mode banner drawing when active
- Banner displays at bottom of screen when no other menus are open

## 🎨 Visual Design Decisions

### Trash Icon
- **Normal state**: White color
- **Active state**: Yellow highlight (consistent with wrench tool)
- **Position**: Kept in current location

### Banner
- **Position**: **Top of screen** (consistent with level banner)
- **Background**: Semi-transparent black (0, 0, 0, 0.5) - same as level banner
- **Text color**: Yellow - same as level banner
- **Size**: 2.1x InfoBarHeight - same as level banner
- **Text**: "Eraser Mode: Delete All" or "Eraser Mode: Wires Only"
- **Tap indicator**: "(Tap to toggle mode)" in white text
- **Priority**: Shows when eraser mode is active, hidden if level banner or sim paused banner is showing

---

## 🔒 Protected Elements

The following elements remain protected from deletion (as per existing logic):
- ✅ Level-provided pins (anchored pins)
- ✅ Input/Output pins in level mode
- ✅ Special chips disabled in level mode

These protections are maintained in the existing `DeleteElements()` method and apply to eraser mode as well.

---

## 🔄 Mode Persistence

- **Eraser mode resets** when:
  - User cancels operations (`CancelEverything()`)
  - User taps trash icon again to toggle off
  - User switches between chips (by design - each chip starts fresh)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Core Functionality
- [x] Trash icon always visible when in edit mode
- [x] Eraser mode toggles on/off via trash icon
- [x] Components delete immediately on tap in eraser mode
- [x] Wires delete immediately on tap in eraser mode
- [x] Banner displays when eraser mode active
- [x] Banner is tappable to toggle "Wires Only" mode
- [x] "Wires Only" mode only deletes wires, not components
- [x] Visual feedback for active eraser mode (yellow highlight)

### ✅ No Regressions
- [x] Normal deletion workflow still works (select → trash icon)
- [x] Copy tool still works
- [x] Other tools (wrench, box select, hint) still work
- [x] Level mode protections still active
- [x] Undo/redo still works

### ✅ Platform Support
- [x] Works on mobile (touch input)
- [x] Mobile-only feature (no PC support needed)

## 📊 Workflow Comparison

### Before (Old Workflow)
1. User taps component to select it
2. Trash icon appears
3. User taps trash icon to delete
**Total: 2 taps**

### After (New Workflow)
1. User taps trash icon to activate eraser mode
2. User taps any component/wire to delete immediately
3. (Optional) User taps trash icon again to deactivate
**Total: 1 tap per deletion** (after initial activation)

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria - All Met ✅

- ✅ Trash icon always visible
- ✅ Eraser mode toggles on/off via trash icon
- ✅ Components delete immediately on tap in eraser mode
- ✅ Wires delete immediately on tap in eraser mode
- ✅ Banner displays when eraser mode active
- ✅ Banner is tappable to toggle "Wires Only" mode
- ✅ "Wires Only" mode only deletes wires, not components
- ✅ Visual feedback for active eraser mode
- ✅ No regressions in normal deletion workflow
- ✅ Works on mobile (touch input)
- ✅ Streamlined workflow (1 tap instead of 2)

---

## 🚀 User Experience Improvements

1. **Faster Circuit Editing**: Delete multiple components quickly without selecting each one
2. **Clear Visual Feedback**: Yellow highlight and banner clearly indicate eraser mode
3. **Intuitive Controls**: Tap trash to activate, tap again to deactivate
4. **Safety Features**: 
   - Mode must be explicitly toggled on
   - Protected elements remain safe
   - Banner clearly shows current mode
5. **Flexible Workflow**: Users can still use old workflow (select → delete) if preferred

---

## 📝 Implementation Notes

- All code follows existing patterns in the codebase
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Clean separation of concerns (state management, UI, interaction logic)
- Comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting
- No linter errors
- Consistent with existing visual design language
- **Mobile-only feature** - uses touch input only (no PC mouse support)

---

## 🎉 Result

The toggleable eraser tool successfully streamlines the deletion workflow, making circuit editing faster and more efficient while maintaining safety through clear visual feedback and protected elements.
