## Questions You Might Have

### Q: Can I skip iOS/Windows/Linux and just do Android?
**A**: Yes, if those aren't actively distributed. Android is the priority.

### Q: Will this break anything for users?
**A**: No, it's a transparent security update. No functionality changes.

### Q: How long until users get the update?
**A**: Google Play review: 1-3 days. Then users get it on next app update.

### Q: What if I find bugs after rebuilding?
**A**: Test thoroughly before uploading. Can do staged rollout on Google Play (5%, 20%, 50%, 100%).

### Q: Do I need to tell users about this?
**A**: Optional, but good practice. Release notes mention "security update" without scary details.

### Q: What if Unity 6000.2.6f2 breaks my project?
**A**: Very unlikely (same major version). If it does, we rollback and investigate. But 99% this will work fine.

## Next Steps - Your Decision

### Option A: Start Now (Recommended)
```
1. Say "Start Unity update"
2. I'll guide you through download and install
3. We'll test project opens correctly
4. Then proceed with rebuilds

Tell me what concerns you have:
- Platform-specific questions?
- Timeline concerns?
- Technical compatibility worries?
- Testing requirements?
```

### Option C: Defer (Not Recommended)
```
If you must defer:
- Set calendar reminder for tomorrow
- This IS a security vulnerability
- Delay = increased risk
```

## My Professional Opinion

As your Project Manager, here's my take:

**This is serious, but manageable.**

‚úÖ You have a clear path forward  
‚úÖ Risk is low if you act now

‚úÖ Unity 6000.2.6f2 is a minor patch (very stable)  
‚úÖ Your project is well-organized  
‚úÖ You have good documentation  
‚úÖ We have a clear plan

## Bottom Line

### The Facts
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Time Needed**: 4-7 hours
