## 📊 Technical Summary

### What's Required

**New Dependencies:**
- `DiscordRPC.dll` (~200 KB)

**New Code:**
- `DiscordRichPresenceManager.cs` (~300 lines)
- `DiscordActivityTracker.cs` (~200 lines)
- `AppSettings.cs` modifications (~2 lines)
- `PreferencesMenu.cs` modifications (~50 lines)

**Total:** ~550 lines of new code + 1 DLL

**Assets Required:**
- 5 PNG images for Discord Rich Presence (512x512px recommended)

---

### Platform Support

| Platform | Supported | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Windows | ✅ Full | Primary target |
| Mac | ✅ Full | Requires Discord Mac app |
| Linux | ✅ Full | Requires Discord Linux app |
| Android | ❌ N/A | Not supported by Discord |
| iOS | ❌ N/A | Not supported by Discord |

---

### Performance Impact

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| CPU Usage | < 0.01% |
| Memory | ~1-2 MB |
| Network | Negligible (local IPC) |
| Battery | None measurable |
| Frame Rate | Zero impact |

**Conclusion:** No noticeable performance impact.

---

### Integration Points with Existing Code

The Discord system reads from these existing DLS systems:

1. **`LevelManager.Instance`**
   - `bool IsActive` → Detect level mode
   - `LevelDefinition Current` → Get level name

2. **`Project.ActiveProject`**
   - `string ActiveDevChipName` → Get chip name
   - `bool isViewingLeaderboardSolution` → Detect solution viewing
   - `string leaderboardSolutionUserName` → Get solution author

3. **`UIDrawer.ActiveMenu`**
   - Detect current menu state (MainMenu, Levels, Preferences, etc.)

**No modifications required to existing systems** - Discord integration is purely read-only and additive.

---

## 💡 Key Insights from Investigation

### Why Rich Presence is a Great Fit for DLS

1. **Community-Requested Feature**
   - Directly addresses @Imred_Gemu's request
   - Shows responsiveness to community

2. **Low Development Cost**
   - 1-3 days implementation
   - Minimal code changes
   - No ongoing maintenance burden

3. **High Community Value**
   - Free marketing (friends see what you're playing)
   - Social engagement boost
   - Professional polish

4. **Technical Simplicity**
   - Well-documented integration path
   - Proven by many Unity games
   - Mature, stable API

5. **Zero Risk**
   - No performance impact
   - Graceful degradation
   - Can be disabled by users
   - Easy to remove if needed

---

### Why NOT to Implement Overlay

1. **Discord Game SDK Deprecated (2022)**
   - No official support for new integrations
   - May break in future Discord updates

2. **High Development Cost**
   - 5-10 days of work
   - Complex native library integration
   - Platform-specific issues

3. **Limited Value for DLS**
   - Single-player game (no multiplayer coordination)
   - Puzzle/creative genre (less need for real-time chat)
   - Alt+Tab works fine for desktop

4. **Auto-Detection Alternative**
   - Discord may auto-detect DLS as a game
   - Overlay might work automatically
   - No development effort required

**Conclusion:** Overlay has negative ROI. Skip it.

## ⚠️ Important Notes for Implementation

1. **Replace Application ID**
   - Don't forget to replace `YOUR_DISCORD_APP_ID_HERE` in code
   - This is the #1 reason implementations fail

2. **Test with Discord Running**
   - Feature only works when Discord desktop app is running
   - Graceful failure if Discord not detected

3. **Asset Key Names**
   - Must match exactly (case-sensitive) between code and Discord portal
   - Common mistake: `icon_Sandbox` vs `icon_sandbox`

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Discord limit: 1 update per 15 seconds
   - Implementation respects this automatically

5. **User Privacy**
   - Some users may not want activity shared
   - That's why user setting is important
   - Default: Enabled (opt-out, not opt-in)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Resources

**If Discord not updating:**
1. Check Discord is running
2. Verify Application ID is correct
3. Check Discord settings: "Display current activity as status message" enabled
4. Wait 15 seconds (rate limit)
5. Clear Discord cache (rare)

**If compilation errors:**
1. Verify DiscordRPC.dll imported
2. Check platform compatibility settings
3. Ensure conditional compilation correct

**For all issues:**
→ See Troubleshooting section in Implementation Guide
