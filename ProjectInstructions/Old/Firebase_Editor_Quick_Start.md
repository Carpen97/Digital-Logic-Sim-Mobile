# 🚀 Firebase in Unity Editor - Quick Start

**Status:** ✅ Ready to use!

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Open Unity Editor
Open your project in Unity Editor (Windows recommended)

### 2. Press Play ▶️
That's it! Firebase automatically initializes.

### 3. Test Leaderboard
Complete a level and submit a score. Check Firebase Console to see it appear in Firestore.

---

## 📋 What Works

✅ Firebase Authentication (Anonymous)  
✅ Firestore database (reads/writes)  
✅ Firebase Storage  
✅ Leaderboards  
✅ All existing PC/mobile builds (no changes needed)

---

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Default: Real Firebase (Recommended)
```csharp
// No configuration needed - works out of the box!
// Just press Play in Editor
```

### Optional: Mock Storage (For Offline Work)
```csharp
// Add at app startup if you want to work offline:
using DLS.Online;
LeaderboardService.UseLocalStorageInEditor = true;
```

## ✅ Expected Logs (Success)

When you press Play, you should see:
```
[Firebase] Starting Firebase initialization...
[Firebase] Dependencies: Available
[Firebase] Firebase app initialized successfully
[Firebase] Anonymous authentication successful. UID: <your-uid>
```

When you submit a score:
```
[Leaderboard] Editor mode with real Firebase enabled - connecting to Firebase
[Leaderboard] Successfully saved score for level <level-id>
```

## ❌ Troubleshooting

### Issue: DllNotFoundException
**Fix:** Close Unity → Delete `Library/` folder → Reopen Unity

### Issue: Timeout/Slow
**Fix:** First run is slower (10-30s). Subsequent runs are faster.

### Issue: Need Offline Mode
**Fix:** Add this at startup:
```csharp
LeaderboardService.UseLocalStorageInEditor = true;
```
