### **Ticket 034** – Auto-open edit tool for single component
**Closed:** 2025-01-28  
**Summary:** Successfully streamlined the editing workflow by automatically opening the context menu when the wrench/edit tool is pressed with exactly one component selected. Reduces tap count from 2 taps to 1 tap (50% reduction). When single component is selected and wrench is pressed, context menu opens automatically centered on screen. Works for all component types: ROM, Key, Pulse, Custom chips, NAND, LED, Button, Pins, and more. Multi-selection and no-selection behavior preserved - wrench mode still activates normally for those cases. Modified MobileUIController.cs to detect single-selection scenarios and ContextMenu.cs to handle deferred menu positioning calculations. Solved UI scope timing issues with proper deferred calculation approach. All existing workflows intact with zero regressions. Verified on actual device with no performance issues. Significant UX improvement for mobile editing workflow. ✅

### **Ticket 037** – Fix Firebase integration on PC
**Closed:** 2025-01-28  
**Summary:** Successfully enabled Firebase integration on PC platform builds (Windows, macOS, Linux) to provide feature parity with mobile platforms. Investigation confirmed Firebase DLLs (.dll for Windows, .so for Linux, .bundle for macOS) were already properly configured and google-services-desktop.json configuration file existed. Primary issue was code-level platform exclusion. Updated FirebaseBootstrap.cs to enable Firebase initialization on standalone platforms (removing UNITY_STANDALONE_WIN/LINUX/OSX from skip conditions while keeping Editor-only skip for development). Modified LeaderboardService.cs to use Firebase on PC builds instead of local storage fallback. Updated FirebaseProbe.cs to clarify PC authentication handling. Result: PC builds now support full Firebase functionality including anonymous authentication, score uploads, leaderboard access, solution sharing, and user name system - achieving complete feature parity with mobile platforms. Editor mode still uses local storage for testing workflow. ✅

---

### **Ticket 045** – Update score info text to emphasize nested NAND chip counting
**Closed:** 2025-01-27  
**Summary:** Successfully updated the score explanation popup to clearly emphasize how nested NAND chips are counted in level scoring. Modified ScoreExplanationPopup.cs to explain that NAND gates inside custom chips are counted recursively. Added explicit examples showing that using a custom chip with 3 NANDs counts as 3 points, not 1. Enhanced user understanding with emphasis on "TOTAL" and "recursive" counting. Text clarifies that the scoring system counts all NAND gates at every nested level. Improved transparency of scoring mechanics to help users optimize their solutions and understand scoring criteria. ✅

### **Ticket 042** – Fix iOS NativeFilePicker for zip file selection
**Closed:** 2025-01-27  
**Summary:** Fixed NativeFilePicker not working on iOS - users were unable to select zip files for project import. Problem: Users could browse through the file explorer and perform actions like move, duplicate, and delete, but could not actually select/import zip files. Root cause: Code was using platform-specific file type formats (iOS UTI strings like "public.zip-archive" instead of MIME types like "application/zip"). The NativeFilePicker plugin expects MIME type format on all platforms and handles iOS conversion internally. Solution: Removed platform-specific conditional compilation directives and standardized on MIME type format for all platforms. Modified Main.cs (project import) and AndroidChipIO.cs (chip import) to use universal MIME types. Verified zip and JSON file selection now works on iOS while maintaining Android functionality. ✅

---

### **Ticket 041** – Fix unsaved changes popup issue in levels
**Closed:** 2025-01-27  
**Summary:** Fixed incorrect unsaved changes popup appearing in levels after saving progress. Resolved multiple root causes: random color generation causing JSON differences, wire object side effects during description creation, inconsistent chip state synchronization after level save, and order of operations issues in new chip creation. Modified DescriptionCreator.cs to use consistent gray color for level chips and removed wire object modifications. Updated LevelManager.cs to synchronize chip saved state with level progress. Fixed BottomBarUI.cs order of operations and updated UndoController.cs method calls. Result: accurate unsaved changes detection in level workflow with no false positive popups after saving progress. ✅
