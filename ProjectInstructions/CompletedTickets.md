## üìã **Completed Tickets**

### **Ticket 033** ‚Äì Extend UI for complex graphics
**Closed:** 2025-01-27  
**Summary:** Investigation completed but implementation unsuccessful. Attempted to extend UI system beyond text and rectangles to support curves, polygons, gradients, and advanced visual elements. Investigation revealed fundamental architectural constraints: existing UI system uses compute buffer-based rendering requiring blittable data types only, making Texture2D support impossible. Multiple approaches tested (Graphics.DrawTexture, GUI.DrawTexture, OnGUI rendering, compute buffer extension) all failed due to rendering pipeline conflicts, coordinate system mismatches, and architectural limitations. Root cause: existing UI system was not architected for texture rendering. Recommendation: Use geometric approximations with existing UI primitives instead of complex graphics. Investigation documented in PNG_Logo_Rendering_Investigation.md. ‚ùå

### **Ticket 032** ‚Äì Add more levels
**Closed:** 2025-01-27  
**Summary:** Successfully created additional levels for the level system to expand gameplay content and provide more challenges for users. Designed and implemented new level scenarios with varying difficulty and complexity including beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. Created levels covering logic gate fundamentals, combinational logic, sequential logic, and practical applications. Ensured proper integration with existing level system including validation, completion tracking, and solution sharing. Enhanced the learning and entertainment value of the game with progressive difficulty curve and educational content. All success criteria met with comprehensive level content creation. ‚úÖ
