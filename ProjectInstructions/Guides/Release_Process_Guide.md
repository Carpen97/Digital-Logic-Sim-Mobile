## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### Unity Build Issues

**Issue**: Build fails with errors
- Check Unity console for specific errors

- Can take 10-30 minutes depending on project size
- Subsequent switches are faster

### Android Build Issues

**Issue**: Gradle build fails
- Check Android SDK is up to date
- Verify JDK version compatibility
- Try `Build ‚Üí Clean All` then rebuild
- Check Unity console for specific Gradle errors

**Issue**: APK too large

- Consider using AAB format (smaller)

### iOS Build Issues

**Issue**: Code signing errors
- Verify Apple Developer account is active
- Check certificates are valid in Xcode
- Ensure provisioning profile is correct
- Try automatic signing in Xcode

**Issue**: Xcode project doesn't open
- Verify Xcode is installed and up to date
- Open `.xcworkspace` if it exists (instead of `.xcodeproj`)
- Try regenerating from Unity

### Store Submission Issues

**Issue**: Google Play rejection

## üìù Notes

### Version Numbering Scheme
- Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `2.1.6`)
- **MAJOR**: Significant changes, major new features

- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, small improvements

### Build Number Guidelines

- **iOS Build Number**: Can be any string, typically matches version or increments (1.0.17, 1.0.18, ...)
- Both must be unique and higher than previous release

### Testing Priorities
1. **Critical**: App launches, version displays, core gameplay
2. **High**: Firebase, file operations, new features
3. **Medium**: UI polish, performance optimizations
4. **Low**: Minor visual issues, edge cases

### Timeline Estimates
- **Documentation**: 30-60 minutes
- **PC Build**: 5-15 minutes
- **Android Build**: 10-20 minutes (Gradle)
- **iOS Build**: 15-30 minutes (Unity + Xcode)
- **Testing**: 1-2 hours per platform
- **Store Submission**: 30-60 minutes per platform
- **Total**: 4-8 hours for complete release
