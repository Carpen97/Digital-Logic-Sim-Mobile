## Project Plan ‚Äì Version 2.0

---

### üìå How We Work

* **Tickets**: All work is broken down into numbered tickets (001, 002‚Ä¶). Only open tickets are kept here. When a ticket is completed, a closure note is written (including the date of closure) and saved offline; it is then removed from this plan.
* **Worker Chats**: Each ticket gets its own dedicated worker chat. Moving forward, these will be handled in **Cursor**, where the worker chat is in charge of coding. The Project Manager (this chat) creates the ticket description and sends an intro paragraph to the worker chat so it knows its role and scope. The worker chat then reports back when work is done.

### üå≥ Git Workflow

**Repository Structure:**
```
Seb's Original (upstream)
    ‚Üì
Community Edition (community) 
    ‚Üì
Mobile Port (origin)
```

**Remotes:**
- `upstream`: https://github.com/SebLague/Digital-Logic-Sim.git (Seb's original)
- `community`: https://github.com/logic-mindful/Digital-Logic-Sim-Community-Edit.git (Community improvements)
- `origin`: https://github.com/Carpen97/Digital-Logic-Sim-Mobile.git (Mobile port)

**Branch Strategy:**
- **`upstream/main`**: Track Seb's original updates
- **`community/main` & `community/dev`**: Track community improvements and features
- **`origin/main`**: Main mobile development branch
- **`merge/mobile-community`**: Integration branch for merging community updates into mobile
- **`mobile-port`**: Legacy mobile development branch

**Workflow:**
1. **Community Updates**: Pull from `community/dev` into `merge/mobile-community`
2. **Mobile Development**: Work on `origin/main` or create feature branches
3. **Integration**: Merge community updates into mobile branch as needed
4. **Upstream Updates**: Periodically check `upstream/main` for Seb's latest changes

**üö® CRITICAL: Unity Scene Safety Rules**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **BEFORE ANY GIT BRANCH OPERATION**: Save Unity scenes (`Ctrl+S` / File ‚Üí Save)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **BEFORE SWITCHING BRANCHES**: Commit any Unity scene changes to git
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER switch branches** with unsaved Unity scene changes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PM MUST WARN USER** before any `git checkout`, `git merge`, or branch switching operation
- üí° **Why**: Git branch switches update scene files, causing Unity to lose unsaved changes when it reloads

### ‚ú® Open Tickets

| ID  | Name                                   | Status | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --- | -------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 019 | Server validation for submissions      | Open   | Cloud Function re-simulates solutions/scores to verify; flags "verified" entries and rejects impossible ones.                                                                                                                         |
| 024 | Component grouping system              | Open   | Add support for grouping multiple components. Selecting multiple components shows a new UI button to create a group. Groups behave as single units for selection/deselection. Groups can also be saved and spawned, similar to chips. |
| 026 | Perpendicular guide for straight lines | Open   | When straight line mode is toggled, draw a perpendicular guide line to assist alignment.                                                                                                                                              |
| 039 | Show dotted wire preview on mobile wire creation| Open   | When creating new wires on mobile, display a preview of the wire path as a dotted line to show where the wire will be placed. Enhance user experience by providing visual feedback during wire creation process. Implement dotted wire rendering for wire preview state before wire is confirmed. Mobile-specific enhancement for touch-based wire creation workflow. |
| 044 | Unity Security Vulnerability Patch (CVE-2025-59489) | Open   | **CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE**: Unity has disclosed CVE-2025-59489 affecting games built with Unity 2017.1+ on Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux. Required actions: (1) Update Unity Editor to patched version via Unity Hub/Download Archive, (2) Rebuild and republish for Android and other affected platforms to Google Play and distribution channels, (3) Alternative: Use Unity binary patcher tool if rebuild not feasible (cannot use if app has tamper-proofing/anti-cheat). Priority: High - Time critical security update. Primary concern: Android distribution on Google Play. Note: Google Play has additional protections but patch is still mandatory. |
| 046 | Add donation button | Open   | Add a donation button to support development of the Digital Logic Sim Mobile project. Button should be accessible from an appropriate location (e.g., About menu, main menu, or settings). Integrate with a donation platform (PayPal, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, or similar). Design should be unobtrusive but visible, matching the existing UI theme. Include optional thank you message for supporters. Consider mobile-optimized placement and ensure it opens donation link in external browser or platform-specific handler. |
| 047 | Add toggleable eraser tool | Open   | Create a special eraser tool that toggles using the existing trash icon. Make the trash icon always visible (currently only shows when component is selected). When toggled, display banner text explaining eraser mode is active. In eraser mode, touching any component on screen will delete it immediately without requiring selection first. Banner should be tappable to switch to "wires only" mode, where only wires can be deleted. Streamline deletion workflow for faster circuit editing. Mobile-optimized tool for efficient component and wire removal. |
