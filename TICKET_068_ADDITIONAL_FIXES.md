# Ticket 068 - Additional Fixes for Preview Issues

## Issues Reported in Testing

### Issue 1: Custom Shape Chips Displayed as Rectangles ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Chips with custom shapes (hexagons, triangles, custom polygons) were shown as rectangles in the preview.

**Root Cause:** The preview rendering used `UI.DrawPanel()` which only draws rectangles. It didn't have the shape-aware drawing logic.

**Solution:** 
1. Created `UI_DrawChipShape()` function that handles all shape types:
   - Rectangle (default)
   - Hexagon
   - Triangle
   - Custom Polygon

2. Implemented UI versions of shape drawing functions:
   - `UI_DrawHexagon()` - Draws hexagons using 6 triangles
   - `UI_DrawTriangle()` - Draws triangles with proper rotation
   - `UI_DrawCustomPolygon()` - Draws custom polygons with vertex transformation

3. Updated `UI_DrawChipBody()` and `UI_DrawChipOutline()` to accept shape parameters and use the new shape-aware drawing

4. Modified preview rendering to pass chip shape information:
   ```csharp
   UI_DrawChipBody(drawCenter, chipSize, chipCol, scale, 
                   chipDesc.ShapeType, chipDesc.ShapeRotation, chipDesc.CustomPolygon);
   ```

**Files Modified:**
- `Assets/Scripts/Graphics/UI/Menus/ChipLibraryMenu.cs` (lines 1836-1946, 1801, 1815)

### Issue 2: Nested Special Chips Show "CUSTOM" Instead of Actual Display ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** When a chip contains a display of another chip (e.g., 7-segment on a custom chip), the preview showed a cyan rectangle with "CUSTOM" text instead of rendering the actual display.

**Root Cause:** The `DrawCustomChipDisplay()` function was a placeholder that didn't look up the actual chip type being displayed.

**Solution:**
1. Modified `DrawCustomChipDisplay()` to properly look up nested chip displays:
   - Accepts `parentChipDesc` parameter to access parent chip's structure
   - Finds the `SubChipDescription` by matching `SubChipID`
   - Looks up the chip description from the library by name
   - Renders the actual chip type using `DrawBuiltinChipDisplay()`

2. Updated the call site to pass the parent chip description:
   ```csharp
   DrawCustomChipDisplay(display, displayPos, displayScale, chipDesc);
   ```

**Example Flow:**
```
Custom Chip "MyChip"
  └─ Display (SubChipID=5)
     └─ Look up SubChip #5 → name="7-SEGMENT"
        └─ Look up chip library → ChipType=SevenSegmentDisplay
           └─ Render as 7-segment display (not "CUSTOM")
```

**Files Modified:**
- `Assets/Scripts/Graphics/UI/Menus/ChipLibraryMenu.cs` (lines 2237-2268, 2216)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Shape Drawing Implementation

#### Hexagon Drawing
```csharp
static void UI_DrawHexagon(Vector2 centre, Vector2 size, Color col, float rotation)
{
    // Calculate 6 vertices in a circle
    // Apply rotation
    // Draw as 6 triangles from center
}
```

**Key Points:**
- 6 vertices at 60° intervals
- Supports rotation
- Rendered as triangles for GPU efficiency

#### Triangle Drawing
```csharp
static void UI_DrawTriangle(Vector2 centre, Vector2 size, Color col, float rotation)
{
    // Calculate 3 vertices
    // Apply rotation
    // Draw single triangle
}
```

**Key Points:**
- 3 vertices at 120° intervals
- Supports rotation
- Direct triangle rendering

#### Custom Polygon Drawing
```csharp
static void UI_DrawCustomPolygon(Vector2 centre, Vector2 size, Color col, float rotation, CustomPolygonData polygonData)
{
    // Transform normalized vertices to world space
    // Scale by chip size
    // Apply rotation
    // Triangulate from first vertex (fan triangulation)
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Handles arbitrary vertex counts
- Applies scaling and rotation
- Uses fan triangulation (assumes convex polygons)
- Gracefully handles invalid data (falls back to rectangle)

### Nested Display Lookup Implementation

**Lookup Chain:**
1. **DisplayDescription** → Contains `SubChipID`
2. **SubChipDescription** → Found by ID in parent's SubChips array → Contains chip `Name`
3. **ChipDescription** → Looked up from library by name → Contains `ChipType`
4. **Rendering** → Uses ChipType to render correctly

**Error Handling:**
- Checks for SubChipID=-1 (built-in displays)
- Warns if SubChip not found by ID
- Warns if chip not found in library
- Gracefully returns without rendering if lookup fails

## Testing Requirements

### Shape Display Testing
Test each shape type in preview:
- [ ] Rectangle chips (default)
- [ ] Hexagon chips (with and without rotation)
- [ ] Triangle chips (with and without rotation)  
- [ ] Custom polygon chips
- [ ] Verify shapes match in-game appearance
- [ ] Verify outline rendering for all shapes

### Nested Display Testing
Test chips with nested displays:
- [ ] Custom chip with 7-segment display inside
- [ ] Custom chip with LED display inside
- [ ] Custom chip with RGB display inside
- [ ] Custom chip with DOT display inside
- [ ] Multiple displays on same chip
- [ ] Verify displays are clipped to chip bounds
- [ ] Verify display positioning is correct

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Invalid polygon data (null, < 3 vertices)
- [ ] Missing SubChipID in parent chip
- [ ] SubChip not found in library
- [ ] Deeply nested displays (display containing display)

## Code Quality

### Linter Status ✅
- Zero linter errors
- All code passes validation

### Performance ✅
- Shape drawing uses efficient triangle rendering
- Lookup operations are O(n) where n = number of subchips (typically small)
- No unnecessary allocations in hot paths
- Masking reuses existing UI mask system

### Maintainability ✅
- Clear function names and documentation
- Error handling with descriptive warnings
- Follows existing code patterns
- Well-structured with clear separation of concerns

---

## Summary

Both preview issues have been successfully fixed:

1. **Custom shapes** - Now render correctly with proper shape type (hexagon, triangle, custom polygon) instead of always showing rectangles

2. **Nested displays** - Now look up and render the actual chip type (7-segment, LED, etc.) instead of showing "CUSTOM" placeholder

The fixes ensure the preview accurately represents how chips will appear in the game, improving user experience and reducing confusion.

**Status:** ✅ **READY FOR TESTING**

All fixes maintain the existing text truncation and display masking improvements from the initial implementation.
