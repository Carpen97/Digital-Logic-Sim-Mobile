## Project Plan â€“ Version 2.0

---

### ðŸ“Œ How We Work

* **Tickets**: All work is broken down into numbered tickets (001, 002â€¦). Only open tickets are kept here. When a ticket is completed, it is moved to [CompletedTickets.md](CompletedTickets.md) with closure details and removed from this plan.
* **Development Environment**: All development work is done in **Cursor** with integrated AI assistance. Cursor provides code completion, refactoring, debugging, and AI-powered code generation directly within the IDE.
* **Workflow**: 
  - Select a ticket from the open tickets below
  - Move it to the "In Progress" section while working on it
  - Work on implementation using Cursor's AI features
  - Test and verify the changes
  - Move to completed tickets when done
  - Use git for version control and collaboration
* **AI Integration**: Cursor's AI assistant helps with code understanding, implementation, debugging, and optimization while maintaining full context of the project.

### ðŸŒ³ Git Workflow

**Repository Structure:**
```
Seb's Original (upstream)
    â†“
Community Edition (community) 
    â†“
Mobile Port (origin)
```

**Remotes:**
- `upstream`: https://github.com/SebLague/Digital-Logic-Sim.git (Seb's original)
- `community`: https://github.com/logic-mindful/Digital-Logic-Sim-Community-Edit.git (Community improvements)
- `origin`: https://github.com/Carpen97/Digital-Logic-Sim-Mobile.git (Mobile port)

**Branch Strategy:**
- **`upstream/main`**: Track Seb's original updates
- **`community/main` & `community/dev`**: Track community improvements and features
- **`origin/main`**: Main mobile development branch
- **`merge/mobile-community`**: Integration branch for merging community updates into mobile
- **`mobile-port`**: Legacy mobile development branch

**Workflow:**
1. **Community Updates**: Pull from `community/dev` into `merge/mobile-community`
2. **Mobile Development**: Work on `origin/main` or create feature branches
3. **Integration**: Merge community updates into mobile branch as needed
4. **Upstream Updates**: Periodically check `upstream/main` for Seb's latest changes
