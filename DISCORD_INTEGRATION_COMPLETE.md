# ‚úÖ Discord Rich Presence Integration - COMPLETE

## What Was Implemented

Full Discord Rich Presence integration for PC (Windows/Mac/Linux) with the following features:

### 1. **Core Integration** ‚úÖ
- `DiscordRichPresenceManager.cs` - Manages Discord connection and presence updates
- `DiscordActivityTracker.cs` - Automatically tracks game state every 15 seconds
- Graceful degradation when Discord isn't running
- Respects user settings (can be toggled on/off)

### 2. **Features** ‚úÖ
- Shows current activity in Discord:
  - **Level Mode**: "Level: [Name]" | "Solving puzzle"
  - **Sandbox Mode**: "Building: [ChipName]" | "Sandbox Mode"  
  - **Viewing Solutions**: "Viewing solution" | "By: [Username]"
  - **Menus**: "In Main Menu", "Browsing Levels", etc.
- Displays elapsed time automatically
- Icons show current mode (level/sandbox/menu)

### 3. **User Settings** ‚úÖ
- Toggle in MainMenu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Discord Integration
- Enabled by default
- Instantly applies when changed
- PC-only (mobile builds unaffected)

### 4. **Code Quality** ‚úÖ
- Conditional compilation (won't break mobile builds)
- Singleton pattern (persists across scenes)
- Rate-limited updates (respects Discord limits)
- Only updates when state changes (performance optimized)
- String sanitization (prevents Discord errors)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING SETUP STEPS

These must be done to make it work:

### Step 1: Download Discord RPC DLL

1. Go to https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp/releases
2. Download `DiscordRPC.1.2.1.nupkg` (or latest version)
3. Rename to `.zip` and extract
4. Copy `lib/netstandard2.0/DiscordRPC.dll` to:
   ```
   Assets/Plugins/DiscordRPC/DiscordRPC.dll
   ```

5. In Unity, select the DLL and configure:
   - ‚úÖ Standalone (Windows/Mac/Linux)
   - ‚ùå All other platforms

### Step 2: Create Discord Application

1. Visit https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Click "New Application"
3. Name: **"Digital Logic Sim"**
4. Copy your Application ID

5. Open `Assets/Scripts/Integration/Discord/DiscordRichPresenceManager.cs`
6. Line 22: Replace `APPLICATION_ID` with your actual ID:
   ```csharp
   private const string APPLICATION_ID = "YOUR_ID_HERE";
   ```

### Step 3: Upload Discord Assets

In Discord Developer Portal ‚Üí Rich Presence ‚Üí Art Assets, upload:

| Key Name | Description | Recommended Size |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| `dls_logo` | Main logo | 512x512px |
| `icon_sandbox` | Sandbox icon | 256x256px |
| `icon_level` | Level icon | 256x256px |
| `icon_menu` | Menu icon | 256x256px |
| `icon_leaderboard` | Leaderboard icon | 256x256px |

**Important**: Key names must match exactly (case-sensitive)!

## Testing

1. Complete all setup steps above
2. Make sure Discord desktop app is running
3. Launch the game
4. Check Discord profile - should show "Playing Digital Logic Sim"
